# **Data Academy** ðŸ“Š

Hello, let me introduce myself:

My name is Daniela Lara ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡½, I am 20 years old and I am currently studying Computer Systems Engineering. I am in love with programming and everything that is related to machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

Here I will be uploading the weekly challenges of Data Academy (all made in Python) and maybe some personal project depending on the dynamics of this 6 weeks planning. I hope you like it and thank you Platzi for the opportunity ðŸ’• .
